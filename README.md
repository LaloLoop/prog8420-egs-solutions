# PROG8420 - Programming for Big Data

This repo contains my solutions for the course part of the [Big Data Solution Architecture][1] program available at 
[Conestoga College - Waterloo Campus][2].

## Usage

The problems are posted here for my personal record keeping, and although you might use them in other open source 
projects, you may not submit them to fulfill the course assignments, since you could be incurring in an [Academic 
Offense][3].

## Projects

Each project has its own description within its folder and can be opened on its own, please read the included README
for each one of them.

## Workflow & Practices

The intention of the repo is to be connected to a set of continuous integration tooling to run the tests. As part of 
the software development practices in use, [Test Driven Development (TDD)][4] is one of them, as well as the [SOLID 
principles][5] while implementing the solutions and whenever it makes sense. The idea is to implement the solutions as 
closely as I would do it in a professional workspace, and if time permits it.
